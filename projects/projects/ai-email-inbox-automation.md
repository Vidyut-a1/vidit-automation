# AI Email Inbox Automation

## Problem
Professionals and teams receive hundreds of emails daily.
Important messages get buried, time is wasted reading everything, and follow-ups are delayed.

## Solution
I built an AI-powered inbox automation that summarizes incoming emails, assigns priority levels, and highlights what actually needs attention.

Instead of reading every email, users get a clean, actionable overview.

## Workflow Overview
1. New email arrives in inbox
2. Email content is extracted and cleaned
3. AI generates a one-line summary
4. Priority level is assigned (high, medium, low)
5. Results are sent to a dashboard or daily digest

## Tools Used
- Make (Integromat)
- OpenAI (summarization + classification)
- Gmail API
- Google Sheets / Email Digest

## Business Impact
- Reduced inbox processing time drastically
- Improved response consistency
- Eliminated manual filtering and sorting

## Notes
Summaries are short, factual, and designed for quick scanning.
All examples use anonymized or sample data.
